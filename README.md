# Spotify Song Popularity Analysis ðŸŽ¶

Hi! Iâ€™m super excited to share my project where I explored a huge Spotify dataset to figure out what makes some songs really popular. As someone who loves music, I wanted to dive into the data and see if I could spot any patterns behind the hits!

## Whatâ€™s in this project?

- **Data Cleaning:** I started by tidying up the dataset, making sure there were no duplicates or missing values so my analysis would be accurate.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), I looked at cool features like danceability, energy, tempo, and more to see how they relate to popularity.
- **Trends & Visualizations:** I made lots of colorful charts to show the most popular songs, artists, and genres, and to see which song features are common in top tracks.
- **Comparisons:** I compared features of popular songs versus less popular ones to find out what really stands out in a hit.

## What did I learn?

- Songs that are more danceable and energetic are often more popular
- Some artists and genres appear again and again in the top tracks.
- Visualizing the data made it easy to spot trends I wouldnâ€™t have noticed otherwise.
- I learned a lot about working with real-world data and using Python for data analysis.

## How to use this notebook

1. Download or open `Spotify_Song_Popularity_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Download the Spotify dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).
3. Run the cells to see the analysis, charts, and my findings.

Thanks for checking out my project! If you love music or data (or both!), I hope you enjoy exploring these findings as much as I did.
