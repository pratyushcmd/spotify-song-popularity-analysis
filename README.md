ðŸŽµ Welcome to my Spotify Song Popularity Analysis! ðŸŽµ

I love music and I was super curiousâ€”what makes a song popular on Spotify? So I grabbed a huge dataset of songs and dove into the data! I looked at things like danceability, energy, and genre to see what the most popular hits have in common. Along the way, I made lots of colorful charts and found some cool patterns.

Introduction
Hi! I love listening to music on Spotify, so I thought it would be super fun to look at a huge bunch of songs and figure out what makes some of them really popular! In this project, I used real Spotify data to explore which song features and artist or genre trends are linked to high popularity.

Dataset
Source: Spotify Dataset on Kaggle, containing over 100,000 tracks with audio features and metadata.

Features include: track_name, artists, popularity, danceability, energy, valence, tempo, duration_ms, and more.

Note: The dataset is not included in this repo due to size/licensing, but you can download it from Kaggle.

Project Goals
Clean and explore the Spotify tracks dataset.

Visualize how features like danceability, energy, and tempo relate to popularity.

Identify patterns among top artists and genres.

Summarize insights that could help predict or understand what makes a song a hit.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook covers:

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Popularity distribution analysis

Top and bottom songs by popularity

Most frequent artists among top tracks

Genre analysis (if available)

Correlation heatmap of audio features

Feature vs. popularity scatter plots

Distribution comparisons for popular vs. unpopular songs

Key Findings
Popular songs are often more danceable and energetic.

Certain artists and genres appear more frequently among top tracks.

Audio features like valence and tempo also show interesting trends with popularity.

How to Run
Download the notebook (Spotify_Song_Popularity_Analysis.ipynb) from this repo.

Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Download the dataset from Kaggle.

Upload the dataset to your Colab or Jupyter environment.

Run the notebook cells from top to bottom.

Conclusion
Wow, that was awesome! After looking at all the songs, I found out that popular songs often have more energy and are easier to dance to. Some artists and genres show up a lot in the top songs, too! I had so much fun exploring this and now I feel like a music detective. I canâ€™t wait to do more projects like this and learn even more cool stuff with data!
